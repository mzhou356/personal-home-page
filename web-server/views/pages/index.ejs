                    The Roux Academy gets thousands of submissions every year
                    for artists interesting in participating in the CAC
                    exhibits, and selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of
                    contemporary art for display in their collective exhibit. In
                    addition, 12 individuals are honored as Featured Artists -
                    each being granted his or her own exhibit hall to display
                    entire collections or themed pieces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at one of
                    our meetups and share his or her vision, perspective, and
                    techniques with attendees on a more personal level than at
                    our large conference. It is truly an honor to be a CAC
                    Featured Artist and many past students artists who were
                    featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant careers in art.
